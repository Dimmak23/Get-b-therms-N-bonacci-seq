# Get-b-therms-N-bonacci-seq

N-bonacci numbers.

The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers that starts with
a one or a zero, followed by a one, and proceeds based on the
rule that each number is equal to the sum of the preceding
two numbers: 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ... 

We can generalize this to an N-bonacci sequence, where the sum
of the preceding N  numbers form the next term. 
For example, a 3-bonacci sequence is the following: 
0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, ... 

Write a program which takes two inputs: N and M, and gets the
M-th term of any N-bonacci sequence. 

For example: 
Input: (N, M) = (4, 13) 
Output: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 29, 56, 108, 208 

Bonus: Try to solve this both recursively and iteratively. 

Here is recursive solution.

Report me if you find any bugs.

Good luck!
